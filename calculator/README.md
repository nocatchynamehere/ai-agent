# ðŸ§® Terminal Calculator

This is a lightweight command-line calculator written in Python. It evaluates basic arithmetic expressions using standard infix notation and displays the result in a clean, boxed ASCII format. The calculator handles operator precedence correctly and includes basic error handling for malformed input.

This module was used as the "legacy code" target for an AI-powered code assistant project.
