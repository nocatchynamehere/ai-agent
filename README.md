# 🔧 AI Code Assistant + Legacy Project Refactor

## ⚠️ **Security Notice:**  
This tool includes guardrails such as path whitelisting and a 30-second execution timeout. However, it does execute local Python files and **must not** be used with untrusted or user-submitted code unless further sandboxing (e.g., containers, firejailing) is added.

## 🧠 Project Summary

This is a two-part educational project that demonstrates:

1. How to build a secure, CLI-based AI assistant using the Gemini API  
2. How to use that assistant to review and refactor a poorly written legacy Python module (calculator)

The result is a powerful example of AI-assisted software engineering — blending prompt design, code analysis, and Python tooling.

## 🚀 Part 1: AI Assistant – `agent.py`

This script sets up a lightweight terminal-based assistant using the Gemini 2.0 Flash model.

## ✅ Features

- Terminal-based AI assistant using Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Secure `.env` API key loading
- Guarded file execution via `run_python_file.py` with:
  - Path traversal protection
  - Extension filtering
  - Execution timeouts
- Output formatting (stdout/stderr/result codes)
- Works with `uv` and `pyproject.toml` for dependency isolation

### 🧪 Usage
```bash
uv run agent.py "What is the time complexity of bubble sort?"
uv run agent.py "Improve the following Python function..." --verbose
```

## 🛠️ Part 2: Calculator Refactor

The `calculator/main.py` file contains intentionally poor or incomplete code. We'll use the AI agent to:

1. Review the original code  
2. Identify and correct logic errors, poor design, or lack of features  
3. Create a cleaner, modular, and well-documented version  

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice integrating with an LLM (Large Language Model) API  
- Demonstrate prompt engineering for debugging and refactoring  
- Refactor legacy code into maintainable, readable components  
- Show AI's role as a **developer copilot**, not a magic solution  

---

## 🔐 .env File Example

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

---

## 📋 Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
uv sync
```

Contents:
```
python-dotenv
google-generativeai
```

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add support for code streaming or multiline responses  
- Interactive loop mode (like a chatbot shell)  
- Load code directly into the AI prompt from file  
- Add logging or output-to-file options
